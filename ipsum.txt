Each kangaroo must have it's own private hat.
You can do anything your heart can imagine.
Let your imagination be your guide.
Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first.

Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out.
You have freedom here.
The only guide is your heart.
Let's go up in here, and start having some fun

Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall.
Let the paint work.
Work that paint.
Let's make a nice big leafy tree.

This is unplanned it really just happens.
When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose.
And just raise cain.
Think about a cloud.
Just float around and be there.
In this world, everything can be happy.
I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush.

Have fun with it.
Be careful.
You can always add more - but you can't take it away.
Painting should do one thing.
It should put happiness in your heart.
Tree trunks grow however makes them happy.
Nice little clouds playing around in the sky.
Let's build some happy little clouds up here.

If you overwork it you become a cloud killer.
There's nothing worse than a cloud killer.
I guess that would be considered a UFO.
A big cotton ball in the sky.
If it's not what you want - stop and change it.
Don't just keep going and expect it will get better.
This is truly an almighty mountain.
It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet.

Don't fiddle with it all day.
We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents.
You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy.
I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting.
Trees grow however makes them happy.
